# Scientific Computing course project

## Getting started

This repository uses *uv* to manage Python and its dependencies, and *pre-commit* to run automatic code linting & formatting, and Jupyter notebook cleanup prior to git commits.

Be cautious to the optional question where you will use parallel SOR algorithm. Since we use only one Notebook to contain all the Q&As, there will be a problem if we run the parallel cell.

Once you run this cell, the other cells will be much slower. What you can do to solve this issue:

Run **Kernel -\> Restart & Clear Output** to clear the Notebook's state and then rerun it.
